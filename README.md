# No Titlebars theme for Cinnamon and the Gnome Desktop Environment 

This is a window border theme that disables most window decorations. It's
intended for people who use keybindings to do everything that the titlebar would
ordinarily do, and who would like to regain the screen space otherwise lost on
window decorations. This theme removes all titlebars. It doesn't only remove
titlebars for maximized windows like other tools.

This should work with Gnome Desktop, but I only tried it with Cinnamon so I
can't say for sure. Let me know if it doesn't.

## Installation

Download this repository as a ZIP, unpack it and move the “No titlebars” folder
into `~/.themes/`. You can delete `README.md` and the screenshot, they're only
there for the Github page. Open up the theme settings for your desktop
environment and choose “No titlebars” for window borders. It should start
working immediately after.
